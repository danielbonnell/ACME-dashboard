ACME Dashboard
====
This is a simple app for a coding challenge. The goal was to turn a static mockup into a semi-interactive mockup. The original mockup was designed using a Bootstrap theme called [AdminDesigns](admindesigns.com/framework/documentation/index.html). I decided to use Foundation instead of Bootstrap because I am much more familiar with it. Using Foundation still proved to be a challenge however, as I had to add quite a bit of custom CSS to get the desired appearance.

## Basic Features
I used Foundation for the front-end framework and incorporated a significant amount of custom CSS. I used HighCharts for the charts and graphs. I also incorporated the jQuery DatePicker into the app, although I didn't have time to style it.
